    permissions to invoke the program.

    \value Crashed The process crashed some time after starting
    successfully.

    state of QProcess is unchanged, and you can try calling
    waitFor...() again.

    process. For example, the process may not be running, or it may
    have closed its input channel.

    \value ReadError An error occurred when attempting to read from
    the process. For example, the process may not be running.

    \value UnknownError An unknown error occurred. This is the default
    return value of error().
